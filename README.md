# Student Performance Prediction using ML

This project involves predicting student performance using machine learning techniques, based on multiple academic and personal features like gender, study time, parental education, absences, and more. The model helps to assess how various factors influence final grades and provides valuable insights to improve student outcomes.

---

##  Objective

To analyze and predict students' final grades (`G3`) using relevant features and machine learning models like:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor

---

##  Dataset

The dataset includes features like:
- Demographic information (sex, age)
- Academic background (study time, failures)
- Lifestyle (internet access, health)
- School-related support (extra paid classes, parental support)

Target variable: `G3` (Final Grade)

---

##  Features Used

- `sex`
- `age`
- `studytime`
- `failures`
- `schoolsup`
- `famsup`
- `goout`
- `health`
- `absences`
- And others...

---

##  Models Implemented

- **Linear Regression**: For basic grade prediction.
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Tree-based modeling with better interpretability.
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Ensemble learning to boost performance and reduce overfitting.

---

##  Evaluation Metrics

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- RÂ² Score

---

## Results

The models showed varying accuracy, with **Random Forest Regressor** performing the best in predicting the final student grades accurately.

---

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualization)
